### Senior-level automated testing frameworks built with modern engineering practices — designed for reliability, clarity, and velocity.

</div>

---

## 🔥 Welcome

I engineer **automation systems**, not scripts.

My frameworks are built for:
- High signal, low noise  
- CI/CD stability  
- Zero-flake execution  
- Fast iteration  
- Clean abstractions  
- Test strategy clarity  

Every repository in this portfolio reflects **real engineering standards**, not classroom demos.

# 🧠 Automation Philosophy

> **Automation is an engineering discipline.**

I operate by these principles:

- **Stability > Speed**  
- **Clarity > Cleverness**  
- **Architecture > Accumulation**  
- **Truth in CI > Beauty in IDE**  
- **Real Coverage > Illusion of Tests**

Automation isn't written to simulate production —  
it's written to **improve decisions and reduce risk**.
