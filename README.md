🔥 Welcome

I build clean, modern, production-ready automated testing frameworks — and I specialize in bringing clarity to complexity.

This portfolio highlights my work across:
	•	UI Automation (WDIO, Playwright, Cypress)
	•	API Automation (Postman / Newman, Playwright API)
	•	Performance Testing (k6, Load Test Patterns)
	•	Security Baselines (OWASP ZAP + CI scans)
	•	Framework Design (POM, abstraction, utilities, cross-browser)
	•	CI/CD Integration (GitHub Actions)

My approach focuses on:

✔ Reliability
✔ Readability
✔ Maintainability
✔ Real-world patterns
✔ Minimal flakes
✔ Developer productivity

This is how I ship automation that matters.

🧩 Portfolio Overview

Below are the curated, production-quality repos recruiters and hiring managers care about.

Each repo represents a different dimension of SDET capability.

⸻

1️⃣ WebdriverIO + TypeScript — UI Automation (Flagship)

Repo: https://github.com/jptrp/saucedemo-wdio-automation

Tech: WDIO · TypeScript · POM · Allure · GitHub Actions
Highlights:
	•	Clean Page Object Model architecture
	•	3 test suites: Smoke · Regression · E2E
	•	Custom utilities: waits, helpers, logger
	•	ESLint + Prettier + Husky pre-commit
	•	Allure reporting with GitHub Pages deployment
	•	Screenshots on failure
	•	Robust CI/CD pipeline
	•	Fully typed and documented

This repo demonstrates framework ownership and end-to-end automation engineering.

⸻

2️⃣ API Testing — Postman + Newman

Repo: https://github.com/jptrp/saucedemo-api-testing-postman

Tech: Postman · Newman · JSON schema validation · CI/CD
Highlights:
	•	11-endpoint API test suite
	•	Schema validation + negative tests
	•	Performance thresholds (response times)
	•	Token chaining and environment variables
	•	GitHub Actions integration
	•	Clean, organized folder structure

This repo demonstrates API test design, contract checks, and pipeline-driven API quality.

⸻

3️⃣ Playwright UI Automation

Repo: https://github.com/jptrp/saucedemo-playwright

Tech: Playwright · TypeScript · Test Data Fixtures
Highlights:
	•	Modern browser automation
	•	Fast, reliable UI tests
	•	First-class TypeScript support
	•	Cross-browser support
	•	Screenshot + trace artifacts

This repo demonstrates modern automation craftsmanship with Playwright.

⸻

4️⃣ Cypress UI Automation

Repo: https://github.com/jptrp/cypress-ui-saucedemo-automation

Tech: Cypress · TypeScript
Highlights:
	•	Fast, repeatable tests
	•	Strong debugging workflows
	•	Custom commands + fixtures
	•	Great visibility into failures

This repo demonstrates breadth across frameworks (Cypress, WDIO, Playwright).

⸻

5️⃣ Performance + Security Testing (k6 + ZAP)

Repo: https://github.com/jptrp/k6-zap-perfsec-automation

Tech: k6 · OWASP ZAP · GitHub Actions
Highlights:
	•	Load testing with thresholds
	•	OWASP ZAP baseline security scanning
	•	CI/CD automated checks
	•	Combined perf + security signals

This repo demonstrates non-functional testing — a major differentiator in modern SDET roles.

🧠 Test Automation Philosophy

Automation is not about writing tests — it’s about enabling velocity.

My philosophy centers on:
	•	predictable, flake-free tests
	•	clean POM abstractions
	•	reusable utility layers
	•	readability over cleverness
	•	fast iteration loops
	•	stable CI/CD pipelines

I build frameworks that reduce complexity so teams can focus on shipping features safely.

🌀 Final Note

This portfolio represents not just code —
but the way I think about testing, engineering, and product quality.

If you’d like a tailored walkthrough of any repository, I’m happy to provide one.
