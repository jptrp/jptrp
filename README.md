## 🏆 Key Achievements

### Real-World Problem Resolution
Diagnosed and resolved upstream API dependency failure (reqres.in authentication issue) by leading a complete migration to JSONPlaceholder. Updated 6 files (tests, CI, docs, configs) simultaneously while maintaining 100% test integrity. **Result**: Restored CI reliability with 60% improved response times.

### Performance Engineering at Scale
Designed and executed three-tier performance testing strategy validating system under realistic and extreme load. Stress tested to **100 concurrent users** with **zero failures**, demonstrating **95% headroom** below performance thresholds (p(95) = 67ms vs 1500ms target).

### Test Automation Framework Design
Built enterprise-grade Cypress framework with strict TypeScript + POM pattern. Implemented parallel execution (2 containers) reducing test time by 50%. Delivered 25+ test cases with 100% maintainability through production-grade architecture.

## 📈 Interview-Ready Story

> **"When our performance test suite detected 100% request failures, I diagnosed the root cause as an upstream API adding authentication requirements. Rather than patch around it, I led a complete architectural migration to a stable API, updating all test scripts, CI workflows, Docker configurations, and documentation. I retuned performance thresholds based on the new API's characteristics and validated with a stress test executing 154,000+ requests at 257 req/sec with zero failures. This demonstrated my ability to maintain pipeline reliability under changing external dependencies."**
